## 🔮 Future Expansion

This Laravel setup makes it easy to add the full Bake & Grill POS system later:

1. **No additional setup needed** - Laravel is already configured
2. **Controllers ready** - Just add new controllers for POS features
3. **Database ready** - Run migrations when POS system is ready
4. **Routing ready** - Add new routes alongside the opening soon page
5. **Asset management** - Use Laravel's asset helpers for all resources

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Page shows Laravel error
- Check that document root points to `/public/` folder
- Ensure `.env` file exists and has correct settings
- Verify file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)

### Logo doesn't display
- Check that `logo.svg` exists in `public/` folder
- Verify asset helper is working: `{{ asset('logo.svg') }}`

### Countdown not working
- Check JavaScript console for errors
- Verify date format in opening date JavaScript

- [ ] `logo.svg` in `public/` folder  
- [ ] `.env` configured for production
- [ ] Application key generated
- [ ] File permissions set correctly
